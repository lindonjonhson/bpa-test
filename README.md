# bpa-test
Automation test

For this script to work it is necessary to have 2 things:
 - .env file, which will contain the 'SERPAPI_API_KEY' and the application's username and password.
 - bpa.rdp, which is the file that will allow you to connect to the remote machine. It is also necessary to have logged into the remote machine previously.
